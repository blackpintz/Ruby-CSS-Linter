## Ruby-CSS-Linter

The projects checks linter errors in CSS files.

### Description

I used a gem called css_parser to locate and parse css files. Then, defined five lint errors that I want the css files
to check against.
They linters set some of the following rules:

- Do not use px measurements.
- All selector names should be in lower case.
- The file should not use more than four ID selectors.

When the file fails to lint checkers, it throw a red colored error giving the warning.

## Built with

-Ruby

## Getting Started

Clone the git repository.

cd into the project.

Some css files have been created, in the tester_file folder, for testing purposes. If you prefer to use your

own css file, create a css file in the tester_file folder and change the path in the bin/main.rb file.

## Linter commands

Run ```puts test_file.access_file('../../tester_file/styles.css')``` to confirm if your css file is accessible. 
If so it should print the content of css on the terminal.

Run ```bin/main.rb``` to find the lint errors in the css file you choose.


### Good and bad code

## Bad code

```div{ width: 10px}``` using px as a measurement unit.

```.html {}``` using html tag as a class selector.

```.Help {} ``` using a capitalized class selector.

## Good code

```div{ width: 10rem}``` using rem as a measurement unit.

```.webpage {}``` using a class selector that is not html.

```.help {} ``` using a lower class selector.

## Project Issues 

The css_parser gemfile may or may not load. In that case, try different css_parser versions until
you find one that works.
